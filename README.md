# Employee Management System  

## Description  

This application is a React-based Employee Management System with secure file storage implemented using Supabase. It leverages Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure that employees can only access and manage files relevant to their roles and permissions.  

## Features  

*   **Employee Profile Management:**  
    *   Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee profiles.  
    *   Store employee details such as name, department, role, contact information, etc.  
*   **Role-Based Access Control:**  
    *   Clearly defined roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee) with specific permissions.  
    *   Users are assigned roles that determine their access to features and data.  
*   **Secure File Storage:**  
    *   Upload, download, and manage files associated with employees or departments.  
    *   Files are stored securely in Supabase Storage.  
*   **Row Level Security (RLS):**  
    *   RLS policies enforce data access restrictions based on user roles and relationships.  
    *   Ensures that employees can only view or modify files they are authorized to access.  
*   **User Authentication:**  
    *   Secure user authentication through Supabase Auth.  
    *   Login/Registration functionality.
*   **User Interface:**  
    *   Clean and intuitive user interface built with React.  
    *   Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.  

## Technologies Used  

*   **React:** Frontend framework for building the user interface.  
*   **Supabase:** Backend-as-a-service providing database, authentication, and storage.
